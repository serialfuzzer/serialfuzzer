Hi, I hope you're having a great day! 


```
"One of the greatest programmers, Donald Knuth, describes programming not as
telling a computer how to do something, but telling a person how they would
instruct a computer to do something. The point is that programs are meant to be
read by people, not just computers. Your programs will be modified and updated
by others long after you move on to other projects. Thus, programming is not as
much about communicating to a computer as it is communicating to those who
come after you. A programmer is a problem-solver, a poet, and an instructor all at
once. Your goal is to solve the problem at hand, doing so with balance and taste,
and teach your solution to future programmers."
