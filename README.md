Hello! I hope you're having a great day. I'm an ethical hacker who also dabbles in coding. If you wish to connect with me, feel free to open an issue in one of my repositories.

Currently, I'm focusing on defensive projects. While I do engage in offensive projects, they are kept private and strictly limited to bug bounty programs. I may consider open-sourcing them in the future, but only when I'm confident about the available defenses.

Lastly, take note of the hit count below. It represents the number of times people viewed this profile and mistakenly executed a non-intended package on their system due to typos. However, this counter might not see much activity going forward. The project unintentionally caused issues for other projects aimed at public good.
